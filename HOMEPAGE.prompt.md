Today's task: Update homepage language for authenticity and credibility
Key requirements from strategy:

Superior organization and user experience
Local authority positioning without false claims
Maintain quality over quantity messaging

Language Updates Needed:
Replace current "We Live Here" positioning with "Utah Local Experts" approach:
"Local Expertise" section:
Change to: "Utah locals who know Park City's dining scene inside and out. No generic travel writer content here."
"Why Trust Park City Best?" section:

Replace "We Live Here" heading with "We Know Park City"
Replace body text with: "As Utah area locals who visit Park City regularly, we've personally experienced these restaurants multiple times. We know which places locals recommend and which are tourist traps."

Other language fixes:

Change "Park City residents who actually eat at these restaurants" to "Utah locals who know Park City inside and out"
Update any other resident claims to "frequent visitors" or "local area experts"

Maintain all other messaging: Keep quality over quantity, detailed research, no paid placements, and all current structure/design.
Build this following the technical requirements and content standards outlined in STRATEGY.md.
